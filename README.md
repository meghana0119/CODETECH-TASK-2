Overview of the Project

Project:
This project involves developing a fraud detection model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Using logistic regression and techniques like SMOTE for handling class imbalance, the model is trained to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

Objectives:

Classify Transactions: Build a model to classify credit card transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
Handle Class Imbalance: Apply SMOTE to address class imbalance and improve model performance.
Evaluate Performance: Assess the model using various metrics such as confusion matrix, ROC-AUC score, and precision-recall curve.

Key Steps:

Data Loading: Import and explore the credit card transaction dataset.
Data Preparation: Clean the data by handling missing values and separate features from the target variable.
Feature Scaling: Standardize features for better model performance.
Class Imbalance Handling: Use SMOTE to balance the classes in the training dataset.
Model Training: Train a logistic regression model on the processed data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using confusion matrix, classification report, ROC-AUC score, and precision-recall curve.

Technologies and Libraries:
Python: Programming language used for data manipulation, model training, and evaluation.
Pandas & NumPy: Libraries for data handling and numerical computations.
Scikit-learn: Library for machine learning and model evaluation.
Imbalanced-learn: Library for handling class imbalance with SMOTE.
Matplotlib: Library for plotting ROC and precision-recall curves.

Results:
The project provides a comprehensive approach to detecting credit card fraud, utilizing logistic regression and advanced techniques to ensure accurate classification and effective handling of imbalanced datasets.
